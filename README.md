# Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Description
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient medical data with Logistic Regression.  
It allows users to input patient information and get a prediction of whether the patient is likely to have heart disease.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict heart disease from medical data
- Provide early detection support for doctors and patients
- Learn and demonstrate machine learning concepts

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Load patient dataset from CSV (`heart_disease_data.csv`)  
2. Separate features (x) and target (y)  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train Logistic Regression model  
5. Evaluate model accuracy on train and test data  
6. Predict new patient input
